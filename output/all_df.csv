The shift to agriculture about 12,000 years ago sparked population growth that led to the emergence of groups with hierarchical structures: associations of clans first, then chiefdoms, and finally, bureaucratic states. Text 2 In a 2021 book, anthropologist David Graeber and archaeologist David Wengrow maintain that humans have always been socially flexible, alternately forming systems based on hierarchy and collective ones with decentralized leadership. The authors point to evidence that as far back as 50,000 years ago some hunter-gatherers adjusted their social structures seasonally, at times dispersing in small groups but also assembling into communities that included esteemed individuals.","Based on the texts, how would Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” presented in Text 1?",By conceding the importance of hierarchical systems but asserting the greater significance of decentralized collective societies,By disputing the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages,By acknowledging that hierarchical roles likely weren’t a part of social systems before the rise of agriculture,By challenging the assumption that groupings of hunter-gatherers were among the earliest forms of social structure,sat-practice-test-4-digital__Reading_and_Writing__1__1

Recent analysis comparing turkey remains at Mesa Verde, one such village in southern Colorado, to samples from modern turkey populations in the Rio Grande Valley of north central New Mexico determined that the latter birds descended in part from turkeys cultivated at Mesa Verde, with shared genetic markers appearing only after 1280. Thus, researchers concluded that _______",Which choice most logically completes the text?,conditions of the terrains in the Rio Grande Valley and Mesa Verde had greater similarities in the past than they do today.,some Ancestral Puebloans migrated to the Rio Grande Valley in the late 1200s and carried farming practices with them.,Indigenous peoples living in the Rio Grande Valley primarily planted crops and did not cultivate turkeys before 1280.,the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde likely adopted the farming practices of Indigenous peoples living in other regions. odule,sat-practice-test-4-digital__Reading_and_Writing__2__17

Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance.

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building. After one minute, an experimenter deliberately spilled a box of pens nearby.","Which finding from the researchers’ study, if true, would most strongly support their claim?",Participants who had been looking at the trees helped the experimenter pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had been looking at the building.,Participants who helped the experimenter pick up the pens used a greater number of positive words to describe the trees and the building in a postexperiment survey than did participants who did not help the experimenter.,"Participants who did not help the experimenter pick up the pens were significantly more likely to report having experienced a feeling of awe, regardless of whether they looked at the building or the trees.",Participants who had been looking at the building were significantly more likely to notice that the experimenter had dropped the pens than were participants who had been looking at the trees.,sat-practice-test-8-digital__Reading_and_Writing__2__16

It also populates the Polynesian Islands, where evidence confirms that Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples were cultivating the plant centuries before seafaring first occurred over the thousands of miles of ocean separating them from South America. To explain how the sweet potato was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that Polynesian varieties diverged from South American ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia was peopled only in the last three thousand years, the team concluded that ______",Which choice most logically completes the text?,the cultivation of the sweet potato in Polynesia likely predates its cultivation in South America.,Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples only within the last three thousand years.,human activity likely played no role in the introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.,"Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild. odule",sat-practice-test-8-digital__Reading_and_Writing__2__17

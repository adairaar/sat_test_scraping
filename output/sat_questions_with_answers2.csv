It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage The Nutcracker each year. But the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences. Text 2 The Nutcracker is outdated, but it should be kept because it’s a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show Hot Chocolate Nutcracker combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",By questioning the idea that the story of The Nutcracker is stuck in the past and by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version,By agreeing that contemporary audiences have largely stopped going to see performances of The Nutcracker because it’s so old-fashioned,By pointing out that most dance companies could increase their incomes by offering modernized versions of The Nutcracker,By suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of The Nutcracker instead of completely rejecting the show 5 CONTINUE

The researchers drew this conclusion from an analysis of more than 50,000 novels spanning many centuries and cultures, using software to recognize and tally both specific time references—that is, clock phrases, such as 7 a.m. or 2:30 p.m.—and implied ones, such as mentions of meals typically associated with a particular time of day.","Which finding from the study, if true, would most directly support the researchers’ conclusion?",Novels published after the year 1800 include the clock phrase 10 a.m. less often than novels published before the year 1800 do.,Novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than do novels from earlier periods.,"Among novels published in the nineteenth century, implied time references become steadily more common than clock phrases as publication dates approach 1900.",The time references of noon (12 p.m.) and midnight (12 a.m.) are used with roughly the same frequency in the novels.

sat-practice-test-7-digital,Reading and Writing,2,9,Multiple Choice,D,"Text 1 Little is known about how plate tectonics—wherein slabs of Earth’s crust move over, under, away from, and against one another—began. Some researchers contend that tectonic movements began around 3 billion years ago, often noting that computer models of Earth’s mantle temperature at the time indicate that the mantle would have been sufficiently molten to enable the plates to move. Text 2 Ultimately, any plausible claim about the inception of tectonic movement must rest on empirical evidence from the geological record. Researcher Wriju Chowdhury and his team analyzed the geochemistry of zircon crystals to gain insight into the chemical composition of the magma from which the crystals formed and, based on the data, compellingly argue that plate tectonics may have been occurring as early as 4.2 billion years ago.","Based on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to what “some researchers contend” as described in Text 1?",By suggesting that the temperature of Earth’s mantle 3 billion years ago was likely insufficient to allow for the level of tectonic movement predicted by computer models,By distinguishing between computer models of Earth’s mantle temperature that reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics and those that do not,By indicating that computer models of Earth’s mantle temperature are still being improved such that new models tend to be much more reliable than their predecessors,By asserting that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth

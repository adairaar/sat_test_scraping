Ecologists’ many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven’t uncovered a satisfactory explanation.

Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance.

sat-practice-test-8-digital,Reading and Writing,2,12,Multiple Choice,C,"Poetry in Classical Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec Empire, relies on difrasismo, or a parallel noun construction that conventionally operates as a single metaphor. For example, the common difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotl(literally, “the eagle, the jaguar”) signifies “warrior.” The device’s function is both formal—providing structure to lines of verse—and ritual: semantic relations among the two nouns and the concept they signify can be tenuous, as in the previous example, such that difrasismos are often only intelligible according to the conceptual associations observed in Aztec ceremonial culture.",Which statement about the difrasismo in cuauhtli in ocelotlis most strongly supported by the text?,Its metaphorical significance derives from the semantic equivalence of the two nouns constituting the difrasismo.,Its unintelligibility may cause its formal function within a line of verse to go unnoticed by present-day readers.,Its apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.,Its frequency in Classical Nahuatl poetry confirms its intelligibility to the Aztec audience.

Keltner, along with Paul K. Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.

To explain how the sweet potato was first introduced in Polynesia, botanist Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues analyzed the DNA of numerous varieties of the plant, concluding that Polynesian varieties diverged from South American ones over 100,000 years ago. Given that Polynesia was peopled only in the last three thousand years, the team concluded that ______",Which choice most logically completes the text?,the cultivation of the sweet potato in Polynesia likely predates its cultivation in South America.,Polynesian peoples likely acquired the sweet potato from South American peoples only within the last three thousand years.,human activity likely played no role in the introduction of the sweet potato in Polynesia.,"Polynesian sweet potato varieties likely descend from a single South American variety that was domesticated, not wild. odule"
